                Go green germinated in 2022 from a promise to make ‘green and healthy’ a click away for all Indians.
                Most of us being urban dwellers spending their days in apartments with limited access to parks and ecological reserves, have no way of feeling close to nature and experiencing the benefits of being around plants.
                Ordering a pizza is easy but ever heard of ordering a plant to your doorstep? This is where Go green comes in.
                We are here to shape the future of gardening!
                A one-stop-shop for all gardening related requirements, Go green has various products available online for delivery across India saving you numerous messy trips to various nurseries.
                We cater to all kinds of gardening needs ranging from plants, pots, tools, to curated plant-scaping solutions.
                We believe that every space can be made more beautiful with plants! Come, join us in our vision to make all spaces green and healthy!
